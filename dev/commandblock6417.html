        <h1>Commandblock6417's bio</h1>
        <h3>Commandblock6417 is an unusual Greek teenager. 
        <br />He likes to fiddle with software and hardware but usually breaks things.
        <br />He uses Mac OS Big Sur and likes to code in C, python, Javascript, albeit he's not that good at any of them.
    	<br />He sometimes plays retro games like the boomer he is or he plays games on his Nintendo Switch. He doesn't play games a lot though.
    	<br />He recently joined Terrific Tea Studios as he is interested in learning more JavaScript and html.
    	<br />He is always trying to improve himself, while he sometimes acts like a tard.</h3>
